git ## Node_Modules and its relationship with package.json.
Package.Json holds the information about the metadata and dependencies a 
project requires. Once a command is given, a computer will look at what is required in the package.json ((names and version numbers)) file and then it will load what is required (actual code, program, extension)  into the node_module folder so that our index can use them.

2. ${} syntax is used for Template literals. It allows us to string variables together. The backticks allow for line coding without having to use special characters. It also alleviates the need to add + in order to add words to a sentence/statement. The + made things look messy and there were often spacing errors.
